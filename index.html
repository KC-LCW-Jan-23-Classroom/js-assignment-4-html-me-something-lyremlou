         <h1>From Freelance Musician to my First Commit</h1>
         <p>It’s been a pretty chaotic few years for a lot of people, yes? Well, for me too.</p>
         <article>
            <h2>Starving Artist for Hire</h2>
            <p>My name is Mary, and I’ve been a freelance musician and teacher for over a decade. I’ve never imagined being able to do anything else until fairly recently. I knew what my calling was since age 10, when I first got my hands on a violin. I was meant to be a musician! Everyone around me seemed to agree! </p>
            <p>Idiots. <em>In this economy???</em></p>
            <p>I went to college later than my peers for several reasons, but I finally decided on getting that violin performance degree I had always dreamed of acquiring.</p>
            <p>And I did! </p>
            <p>I was all set to audition for symphonies, play all the gigs that came my way, and maybe even head to grad school. </p>
            <p>I did not do any of that.</p>
            <p>Just two months after graduating with my degree, I started to exhibit symptoms of a mysterious illness that took 6 months and two hospital visits to diagnose. One of those symptoms was an extreme difficulty to swallow food, which is an affliction I would not wish on my worst enemy. </p>
            <p>Oh, and I had just started dating my now husband. What a way to get to know your future spouse! How decidedly not chill. </p>
            <p>Finally, after slowly regaining my ability to <em>eat food</em>, I received my diagnosis. </p>
            <p>Anxiety. </p>
            <p>LOL. JK. That’s just what they tell you when you’re a woman in the healthcare system and nothing seems to be immediately wrong with you. Everything is due to a delicate constitution and the vapors, apparently. Don’t get me wrong, I had anxiety. But I had anxiety because <em>I COULD NOT EAT</em>, not the other way around. </p>
            <p>My actual, really real diagnosis from a neurologist who was able to look past my unfortunate woman-ness:</p>
            <p><strong>Oromandibular dystonia.</strong></p>
            <p>Dystonia is a movement disorder. My muscles move without my permission, and often painfully. They mostly move without permission in my face, tongue, and jaw. However, dystonia has global effects on the entire body, and I experience a number of inexplicable symptoms that are hard to describe to those without dystonia. </p>
            <p>I soon discovered I no longer had the fine, precision control in my bow arm for which I sacrificed countless hours with friends, video games and <em>fun</em> to achieve. Everything I worked for was gone. What’s more, I could no longer play without pain, and sometimes I even struggled to hold up my violin. </p>
            <p>Bummer, right?</p>
            <p>Oh, yeah. Then the pandemic hits. </p>
            <p>Suddenly, playing a gig is out of the question. Many musicians struggled to make ends meet, and some even quit the profession entirely. I was already struggling because of my dystonia. The pandemic slowed down my life enough to give me the space to come to terms with the fact that music for money was no longer possible. Even though I hadn’t played a gig in over a year, it took me even longer to fully accept. What’s more, I did not know what else to do. The only thing I had ever pursued was music. </p>
            <p>And yeah, that’s kind of restricting. That kind of singular focus doesn’t leave you with any options if your body suddenly falls apart at the tender age of 28, leaving you riddled with chronic pain and a serious lack of funds. </p>
            <p>But damn, I could kinda shred! Or, I used to shred.</p>
            <p>You know what saved me? Reddit.</p>
            <p>I know what you’re thinking. But it’s true. I never would have thought about web development had r/learnprogramming and r/cscareerquestions  not made it to the front page. </p>
            <p>A few things stood out for me when reading about web development/programming:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>So many work from home options! Ideal in a pandemic.</li>
                  <li>Low face to face communication! Ideal when the muscles in your face and tongue have a mind of their own. Sometimes, it just hurts to talk. </li>
                  <li>Money!!!!!!!!!! Self explanatory.</li>
               </ol>
            <p>So, in March of 2022, I began studying web development on my own with The Odin Project. 
               I learned HTML, CSS, and just the teeeeeniest bit of JavaScript. And I was having a good time doing it! Finally, after a lucky chat with a friend, I found out about LaunchCode. A FREE web development boot camp, which is exactly how much I could afford to throw at this new endeavor. I haven’t looked back since.</p> 
            <p>In the spirit of appreciation for my past and how it brought me to this new place in my life, here are some pictures of my students and some cool gigs I’ve played. Also my cat. And my husband and my friends. Basically a bunch of stuff I love, even if I’ve had to leave some of it behind.</p>  
            <p>I’m really grateful for new beginnings.</p>
