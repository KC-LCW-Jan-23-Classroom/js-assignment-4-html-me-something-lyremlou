            <h2>From Freelance Musician to my First Commit</h2>
            <p>My name is Mary, and I’ve been a freelance musician and teacher for over a decade. I’ve never imagined being able to do anything else until fairly recently. I knew what I wanted to do with my life since age 10, when I first got my hands on a violin. </p>
            <img src = images/bandphoto.jpeg alt = "An image of the author playing violin in a band on stage with several other musicians">
            <p>I went to college later than my peers for several reasons, but I finally decided on getting that violin performance degree I had always dreamed of acquiring.</p>
            <p>And I did! </p>
            <img src = images/graduating.jpg alt = "An image of the author graduating">
            <p>I was all set to prepare for auditions, play all the gigs that came my way, and maybe even head to grad school. </p>
            <img src = images/hospital.JPG alt ="An image of the author in a hospital bed, holding a stuffed toy">
            <p>I did not do any of that.</p>
            <p>Just two months after graduating with my degree, I began to exhibit symptoms of a mysterious illness that took 6 months and 2 hospital visits to diagnose. One of those symptoms was an extreme difficulty to swallow food, which is an affliction I would not wish on my worst enemy. </p>
            <p>Finally, after months of slowly starving, I gradually regained my ability to eat food. I received a diagnosis. </p>
            <p>Anxiety. </p>
            <p>This is what health professionals say when you are a woman in the healthcare system and they cannot immediately determine what is wrong. According to harried, pressed-for-time doctors, everything  I was experiencing could be explained away due to a delicate constitution and the vapors, apparently. </p> 
            <p>I certainly had anxiety. But I had anxiety because <em>I could not eat</em>, not the other way around. An additional month would go by, and another hospital visit would be required, before a qualified neurologist would take the time to discover the cause of the chaos in my body. </p>
            <p>My eventual, actual diagnosis:</p>
            <p><strong>Oromandibular dystonia.</strong></p>
            <p>Dystonia is a movement disorder. My muscles move without my permission, and often painfully. They mostly move without permission in my face, tongue, and jaw. However, dystonia has global effects on the entire body, and I experience a number of inexplicable symptoms that are hard to describe to those without dystonia. </p>
            <p>I soon discovered I no longer had the fine control in my bow arm for which I sacrificed countless hours to achieve. Everything I worked for was gone. Additionally, I could no longer play without pain, and sometimes I even struggled to hold up my violin. </p>
            <p>Bummer, right?</p>
            <p> Then the pandemic hits. </p>
            <p>Suddenly, performing in any kind of public space was out of the question. Many musicians struggled to make ends meet, and some even quit the profession entirely. I was already struggling because of my dystonia. However, the pandemic slowed down my life enough to give me the space and time to come to terms with the fact that music for money was no longer an option for me. It took me years to accept&ndash; the full length of the pandemic and then some. It was a difficult process. I loved playing music, and I had made many sacrifices to attain the proficiency on my instrument I enjoyed at the time. But my body had changed. </p>
            <p>The singular focus required to accomplish my musical goals left me with few options. My body seemed to have suddenly fallen apart at the tender age of 28, leaving me with chronic pain and a serious lack of funds. </p>
            <p>Still, I'm thankful for the time I spent pursuing music. Not everyone gets to pursue a dream.</p>
            <img src = images/violin-black-and-white.jpeg alt = "An image of the author with short hair playing violin in black and white">
            <p>I searched for new paths, completely stumped as to what to do next. In the thick of the pandemic, doom-scrolling put web-development on my radar for the first time. Thanks, Reddit.</p>
            <p>It’s true. I never would have thought about web development as an option had r/learnprogramming and r/cscareerquestions not made it to the front page several times. </p>
            <p>A few things stood out for me when reading about web development and programming in general:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>So many work from home options! Ideal in a pandemic.</li>
                  <li>Low face to face communication! Ideal when the muscles in your face and tongue have a mind of their own. Sometimes, it just hurts to talk. </li>
                  <li>Money! Self explanatory.</li>
               </ol>
            <p>So, in March of 2022, I began studying web development on my own with The Odin Project. 
               I learned HTML, CSS, and just the teeeeeniest bit of JavaScript. And I was having a good time doing it! Finally, after a lucky chat with a friend, I found out about LaunchCode. A <em>free</em> web development boot camp, which is exactly how much I could afford to throw at this new endeavor. I haven’t looked back since.</p> 
            <p>In the spirit of appreciation for my past and how it brought me to this new place in my life, here are some pictures of my students and some cool gigs I’ve played. Also my cat. And my husband and my friends. Basically a bunch of stuff I love, even if I’ve had to leave some of it behind.</p>  
            <p id = "testP">I’m really grateful for new beginnings.</p>
